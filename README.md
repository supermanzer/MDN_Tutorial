# MDN_Tutorial
The site built while working through the MDN Django tutorial.  My intent is to provide a simple application in which to test out Django deployment ideas.

## Master Branch
This follows the MDN tutorial fairly closely with a few aesthetic changes (using MaterializeCSS vs. Bootstrap etc.).
The one significant departure is I also create a REST API using Django REST Framework for all my models.  This may come in handy if I try to employ any Angular/Vue/React Javascript approaches.
